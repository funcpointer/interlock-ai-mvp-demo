# InterLock MVP Checkpoints

## checkpoint-2026-05-25-telemetry-fast-eval

Purpose:

- make telemetry the default debugging surface,
- make Kuzu optional for fast loops,
- codify repeatable fixture evaluation.

Changed:

- `ReviewRequest.no_kuzu`
- CLI `--no-kuzu`
- stage-level `logs.jsonl` events
- richer `metrics.json` counters
- `Makefile` eval targets
- scanned eval contract
- updated `PLAN.md`

Required validation:

```bash
make eval-fast
```

Full graph validation:

```bash
make eval-full
```

Checkpoint rule:

- use `eval-fast` after normal code changes,
- use `eval-full` before demo/release or after graph/Kuzu changes.

Known current finding:

- Kuzu build is useful for graph inspection but too slow for inner-loop debugging.
- JSON graph artifacts remain canonical.

Validation result:

```text
make eval-fast
  unit tests: 9 passed
  version gold: 5 findings, 5 review_required, eval passed
  negative: 0 findings, 0 review_required, eval passed
  cross-doc: 7 findings, 4 review_required, eval passed
  scanned: 18 coverage warnings, 0 review_required, eval passed

make eval-kuzu
  version gold: 5 findings, 5 review_required
  Kuzu graph built
```

Runtime signal:

checkpoint-cross --no-kuzu: 0.775s
checkpoint-scanned --no-kuzu: 1.251s
